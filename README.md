A multiplayer shooter game made in unity


Zombies! From outer space! 

A zombie virus is in space. Galactic soldiers must go around space bases clearing out the infected and setting up a defense before leaving. Contractors are hired to do tasks that the galactic soldiers won’t. Like entering a heavily infested horde just to turn on the generators for example. You play as a contractor, you are sent into dangerous situations the galactic army isn’t willing to do. 

Bases are often on lockdown by the time you arrive. Most doors are sealed shut. You can play as a demolitionist to blow up the doors, or a hacker and hack open the doors. Hackers obviously have the advantage of being able to close the door behind them. Whereas, demolitionists have the advantage of completing the mission faster, and killing anything on the other side of the door. 

When faced with a horde you might consider just loading up on weapons and armor. However, there are tank class zombies, who will wreck your f***ing s*** if you don’t have backup. An alternate approach might be sneaking past all the zombies, but this means packing light. You will be heard if you don’t wear the right gear. Don’t stick to silence, as zombies can smell your stink. Cover yourself in bile to throw off the scent, or meat to draw in the horde.
